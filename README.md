# SCL-Interpreter
This is an interpreter for a simple coding language(SCL) described in the Grammar.txt file. For more information on the grammar, please read the Gramar.txt file.

Two example SCL files have been included, NumberComparison.SCL and Fib.SCL. The NumberComparison.SCL file intakes two numbers and outputs which number was larger. The Fib.SCL file
computes the nth fibonacci number, with n being user input.

To compile the files, simply use the makefile included and the C/C++ make utility.

After compiling, to interpret SCL files, use the following terminal command:
./SCL.exe [filename].SCL
